## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt some new things while making this webpage - making a custom logo using CSS, writing text over an image, putting an image and the text side-by-side.

(Although I used the help of internet and ChatGPT, I am learning new things with new projects and I am not blindly copying things, I understand the usecase of each and everything that I use in making of the project.)

### Continued development

The buttons on the page has to be given a soft and small 3D look. And the webpage is not responsive, that will be done.
